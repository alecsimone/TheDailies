<?php /* Template Name: Rules 2 */

<div id="rulespage">

	A play may be entered into the Dailies in any of four ways:
	-If you submit it at Dailies.gg/Enter
	-If it is tweeted @Rocket_Dailies
	-If a clip of it from an event we know about gets more than 3 views
	-If it makes the Top 100 Twitch clips of the last 24 hours

	Plays are only eligible the day they happen, but sometimes it takes them a while to make their way here and we're very forgiving of that.

	You can't enter a high jump contest from the moon. That means no mods or mutators that make it easier for the performer to look cooler. Unlimited boost, shot trading, high bounciness, etc. Nothing like that is allowed, and absolutely no training mode.

	Anyone can vote. Your vote counts as much as your rep, or you can vote against a play and subtract 1/4 of your rep from it. By participating in the Dailies process, you earn the ability to give people rep. Every day you talk in chat or vote on a play, you get one giveable rep point, and every 12 hours you can get one by voting on /Scout.

	Round 1 takes place at Dailies.gg/Scout, where people cast an initial vote on whether the play is worth considering. 

	Round 2 takes place at Dailies.gg/Hopefuls. This is where the stream starts, and only clips that have a positive score from Round 1 make it. We'll review clips from oldest to newest, and clips that get one VoteYea for every five people in chat move to the next round. At their own discretion, the host will kill the clips that don't look likely to advance.

	A play only gets one shot at Round 2, but you may request a second chance with a better clip of the play.

	Round 3 takes place at Dailies.gg/Live. The round begins by reviewing all the plays still in contention. Afterwards, the plays are considered in ascending order of score, and any play that nobody is willing to speak in defense of is eliminated. A play must have roughly one champion for every ten people in chat. People with more rep make stronger champions.

	When enough plays have been eliminated to leave only the top tier, they will be played again and chat must reach a consensus on which to nominate.

	Round 4 takes place at Dailies.gg. The nominees will be posted there until the very end of the last show, at which point they will be replayed and a brief interval will be allowed for any last minute voting, then the one with the most votes will be declared the winner, and everyone's lives will improve significantly.
